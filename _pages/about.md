I am a Research Associate (Postdoctoral Researcher) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). Currently, I am working with Prof. [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/) in the Cambridge NLIP Group. I was a Computer Science PhD at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), supervised by Prof. [Volker Tresp](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp/) and funded by [Siemens AG](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html). I was also a nominated PhD of the [ELLIS Society](https://ellis.eu/), co-supervised by Prof. [Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/). Prior to that, I obtained my MSc degree at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and my BEng degree at [East China Normal University](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/), both in Electrical Engineering. <br>

My research interests include but are not limited to agent AI, temporal reasoning with LLMs, multimodal fact-checking, and LLM hallucination detection/mitigation.<br>

Currently I am a Visiting Research Scientist at Eigent AI, trying to find the scaling laws of AI agents with [CAMEL-AI](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel). I wish to be part of our journey towards AGI.

I am <strong>very interested</strong> in supervising talented PhD, master and bachelor students in publishing top-tier papers. Feel free to send me an email for enquiry. But please note that scientific research is a gradual and continuous endeavor. I hope you have sufficient effort and patience.<br>
